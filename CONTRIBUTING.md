# Contributing to the Self Hosted Show Wiki


## Objectives of This Wiki

In order to contribute well, you need to understand what the objectives are behind this wiki.

What we are trying to create:
- A compilation of tools, tips and tricks for self-hosting specific applications.
- A place where beginners and experts can learn about how to quickly, efficiently and securely deploy applications on their own server(s).
- Snippets that people can quickly reference in deploying applications.
- A hub for quality documentation (to the extent possible).

What we are not trying to do:
- Be another large list of self-hosted tools. See [awesome-selfhosted](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted) for a comprehensive list of self-hosted applications.
- Be a hub for script kitties. People should _learn_ from documentation here not just come here to copy/paste. Snippets are important but should be documented properly.



## Directory Layout:

The `docs` folder in the root of the repository is where wiki content should be placed.

The following example directory layout should be adhered to when contributing:

`docs/category/application.md`


For example, if I wanted to add an article for Home Assistant, my layout could be this:

`docs/home-automation/home-assistant.md`

This would assume that the `home-assistant.md` entry belongs in the `home-automation` category. Look at the existing category directories before attempting to create a completely new category directory.
