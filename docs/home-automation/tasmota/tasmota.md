## Installation
The main ways of installing Tasmota on a device are:
- OTA (over the air).
- Flashing over serial.
OTA is the quickest, if your device supports it. OTA requires a device that has a firmware update mechanism with a "vulnerabulity", so a spoofing update network can upload tasmota, instead of the manufacturers own firmware.
The Tuya-Convert tool allows many devices labled "Tuya - Smart Life".
